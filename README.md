<h1>Simple Javascript Todo List</h1>
<p>
Simple Javascript Todo List is a practice project that allows me to explore javascript further. Through this project, I was able to learn
javascript event listeners, explore further on the concept of drag events, and manipulate the styling of classes from the javascript file.
